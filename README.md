# BrewPerfect ☕

**Because you're still adding sugar to your coffee like it's 2004.**

BrewPerfect is a gorgeous, zero-dependency, single-file web app that guides you through brewing actually good coffee. No frameworks. No build steps. No `node_modules` folder the size of a small country. Just one HTML file that knows more about coffee than your barista.

## What It Does

- **4 Brewing Methods** — Pour Over, French Press, AeroPress, and Espresso. Yes, your Keurig is not on the list. On purpose.
- **Ratio Calculator** — Because "a scoop" is not a unit of measurement, Karen.
- **Step-by-Step Brew Guide** — Live countdown timers, audio beeps, and instructions so precise that even you can't mess this up. Probably.
- **Grind & Temperature Specs** — Dialed in for each method. No more guessing and pretending the result is fine.
- **Morning Alarm** — Set it, keep the tab open, and wake up to a notification telling you it's time to stop being a disappointment and brew proper coffee.

## What It Doesn't Do

- Add sugar
- Support Keurig
- Judge you (ok, it judges you a little)
- Require an internet connection after first load
- Ask for your email, your location, your firstborn, or cookie consent

## Getting Started

```bash
# Step 1: Clone it
git clone https://github.com/MichalHlavacek/brewperfect.git

# Step 2: Open it
open index.html

# Step 3: There is no step 3. It's one HTML file.
# We don't need Docker for this.
```

## FAQ

**Q: Can I add sugar?**
A: You can also mass-reply-all to company emails. You *can* do a lot of things. Doesn't mean you should.

**Q: Why not React?**
A: Because I don't need 47MB of JavaScript to display a countdown timer.

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: It's a single HTML file. It works on a submarine.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: It's a coffee timer, not a nuclear reactor. Yes. Ship it.

**Q: Can I use this at work?**
A: You should be using this at work. Your office coffee is terrible and everyone knows it but nobody says anything.

## Browser Support

Literally anything with a browser. Your phone, your laptop, your smart fridge — I don't care. If it can open an HTML file, it can brew perfect coffee.

## Contributing

Found a bug? Want to add a brewing method? Think I'm wrong about sugar? (I'm not.)

PRs welcome. Just don't add sugar support. I will mass close those with extreme prejudice.

## License

MIT — do whatever you want with it. Make coffee, not lawsuits.

## Author

Made by [Michal Hlavacek](https://github.com/MichalHlavacek) and an mass quantity of mass coffee that was, as always, unsweetened.
